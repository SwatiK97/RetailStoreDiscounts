#### General Information regarding the solution
Items represent goods/products that can be placed in the cart.

A cart contains a number of items, and can compute the total price of its contents.

Cart items can either be actual products with a fixed unit price, or products with a pricing policy attached for any dicounts that are calculated based on items and not the overall discount policy of current cart.

DiscountPolicy is used to calculate or apply different discounts based on overall cart value of contents.
